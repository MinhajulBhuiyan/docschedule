DocSchedule Release Notes (Working Draft)

Summary
- This draft collects planned and completed updates across the stack.
- It is intentionally verbose to provide traceability without changing runtime logic.

Guiding Principles
1. Ship small, frequent, reversible changes.
2. Maintain API compatibility or document breaking changes clearly.
3. Optimize for maintainability and observability.

Planned Enhancements
1. Improve appointment availability caching.
2. Add pagination to all list endpoints in admin portal.
3. Enable audit logs for sensitive admin actions.
4. Add retry strategy for transient network failures in frontend.
5. Introduce rate limits per role (user/doctor/admin).
6. Add soft-delete for news items with restore.
7. Enforce password strength and 2FA for admins.
8. Add doctor schedule import/export (CSV).
9. Add appointment reminders via email.
10. Enable configurable currencies and locale formatting.

Highlights (vNext)
1. New doctor dashboard metrics panels.
2. Enhanced profile edit validations and UX.
3. Accessibility improvements and keyboard navigation.
4. Performance tweaks for images via Cloudinary transformations.

Changelog (Draft Entries)
1. Admin: Introduce Planner component for scheduling.
2. Frontend: Add AppointmentBookingWizard with guided steps.
3. Backend: Add news routes and controller for content management.
4. Security: Include doctor and user auth middlewares.
5. Docs: Expand README with quick start and environment variables.

Quality, Testing, and CI/CD
1. Add unit tests for booking logic edge cases.
2. Integrate integration tests for payment flows (mocked gateways).
3. Configure GitHub Actions for lint + test on PRs.
4. Use feature flags for staged rollouts.
5. Require code owners review on core modules.

Operational Readiness
1. Define SLOs for API latency and error budgets.
2. Establish alerts for elevated error rates.
3. Add dashboards for appointments per hour/day/week.
4. Ensure health and readiness endpoints are monitored.
5. Document incident response playbooks.

Security and Compliance
1. Enforce JWT expiration and refresh strategy.
2. Harden CORS rules by environment.
3. Validate inputs using Joi across all POST/PUT endpoints.
4. Store minimal PII and document retention timelines.
5. Rotate API keys for Cloudinary and payment gateways.

Performance Considerations
1. Use React.lazy for heavy routes.
2. Memoize derived lists in Doctors page.
3. Add DB indexes for frequent appointment queries.
4. Enable gzip/br compression on API responses.
5. Avoid N+1 queries with aggregation pipelines.

UX Improvements
1. Provide clearer empty states for lists.
2. Add skeleton loaders to main dashboards.
3. Offer bulk operations for admin tables.
4. Improve error boundaries and fallback UIs.
5. Standardize button sizes and states.

Internationalization (Future)
1. Externalize all user-facing strings.
2. Detect locale from browser preferences.
3. Format dates and currencies per locale.
4. Provide RTL layout support where applicable.

Accessibility (A11y)
1. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA.
2. Add focus outlines and skip links.
3. Label form inputs and sections with ARIA where needed.
4. Verify keyboard navigation across flows.
5. Provide text alternatives for non-text content.

Data Integrity
1. Use transactions for multi-document updates where needed.
2. Validate state transitions for appointments.
3. Guard idempotency in payment verification callbacks.
4. Ensure deterministic time handling (UTC server-side).
5. Provide migration scripts for schema evolutions.

Observability
1. Correlate logs with request IDs across layers.
2. Measure cold start impact in serverless environments (if any).
3. Track front-end performance metrics (LCP, FID, CLS).
4. Capture user journey funnels for key flows.
5. Aggregate failures by endpoint and error code.

Infrastructure Notes
1. Prefer infrastructure as code for reproducibility.
2. Automate backups and routinely test restores.
3. Keep environments as similar as possible.
4. Control costs with monitoring and budgets.
5. Monitor dependency vulnerabilities and patch promptly.

Roadmap Ideas
1. Chat with doctor (secure messaging).
2. Telemedicine video sessions integration.
3. Insurance verification integrations.
4. Advanced reporting and CSV exports.
5. Appointment waitlist and auto-fill.

Developer Experience
1. Provide sample env files and seed scripts.
2. Document common troubleshooting steps.
3. Maintain consistent lint and format rules.
4. Keep a fast local dev setup with mock services.
5. Publish API examples and Postman collection.
